                                What are the new Visa payment security measures?
                            </p>
                            <p>How our customers pay with their Visa online is about to get even safer and more secure.
                                New security measures, called Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) have been introduced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SCA is part of new laws that come into force right across UK & Europe. These laws
                                introduce security measures called two-factor authentication to help make paying with
                                visa safer for transactions made online and via contactless. They aim to give customers
                                paying with their Visa and businesses accepting Visa payments an added layer of security
                                whilst helping the banks ensure the card holder is authorising the payments. (Joshua,
                                come up with an idea).

                                A wide variety of products from Gallery Bebe have all been thoroughly examined to
                                guarantee the highest standards and levels of quality. For two (2) years after the date
